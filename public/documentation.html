    <h1>Documentation for Movie API</h1>
    <p>The objective of this project is to build a server-side component of a movies web application.
        This will take the form of a REST API. Through the functionality afforded by the API,
        users will be able to search for information on different movies, genres or directors.
        They will be able to sign up, update their personal information and save their favourite movies.
    </p>

    <h2>Endpoints and Request Methods</h2>

    <p>The resources a user could find on this application can be accessed using the URL endpoints and request methods
        below:</p>
